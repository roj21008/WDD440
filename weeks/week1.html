<h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
    <p>The Document Object Model is a programming interface that allows us to create,
     change, or remove objects from the document. We can also add events to the document to make the page more dynamic.</p>
<h3>What is the difference between Imperative vs Declarative Programming
     - Think about the difference between step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza vs just ordering a pizza.</h3>

     <h4>Imperative programming</h4>
     <p> Involves giving the computer step-by-step instructions on how to do something. For instance, if you were to tell a computer how to make a pizza, you'd need to describe each step: making the dough, adding sauce, spreading toppings, and baking.</p>
     <h4>Declarative programming</h4>
     <p>It tells the computer what the end goal is without specifying each step. Ordering a pizza is declarative—you say, "I want a pepperoni pizza," without detailing how to make it. The same idea applies in code: instead of specifying each step, you declare the result, and the program handles the details.</p>
     <p>In React, a popular library for building interfaces, we write code declaratively. We describe what we want the interface to look like, and React figures out how to make it happen in the DOM.  </p>

<h3>What is JSX - the syntax extension for JavaScript?</h3>
<p>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a sintax that allows to write HTML like a code within JS. It’s used heavily in React to define what the UI should look like.</p>
<h3>What is the Babel interpreter?</h3>
<p>It is a complier or interpreter that translates  modern Java Scripts into a version that older browsers can understand. Babel also converts JSX into standard JavaScript that can be processed by the browse</p>
